# Model

In this attempt, I will use the same three types of neurons that I used in [attempt1](https://github.com/unixpickle/AI-attempts/tree/master/attempt1). However, instead of evolving a single organism, I will introduce the process of reproduction. This way, it is easy to revert changes (i.e. if organism A gives birth to a worse organism B, organism A can survive while organism B dies).

# Reproduction

Organisms will reproduce at a rate proportional to the amount of pleasure they have experienced. Their children will be altered semi-randomly, just like in attempt1.
